	<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h1>
	<p><a href="http://alistapart.com">A List Apart</a> and <a href="http://stet.editorially.com">Stet: A Writers' Journal on Culture &amp; Technology</a></p>
	<h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h1>
	<h2><a href="http://alistapart.com">A List Apart</a></h2>
	<p>The large top image is often a graytone illustration, while the site and article titels are thick, black sans-serifs that frame the drawings without visual competition.</p>
	<p>However, in cases where the main top image is either a screencap or a photograph, and in articles where in-article illustrations contain text, there is a fair amount of visual conflict, either due to weight of images or to the fact that they are "off-stylesheet."</p>

	<h2><a href="http://stet.editorially.com">Stet: A Writers' Journal on Culture &amp; Technology</a></h2>
	<p>Large, full-color top image evokes print magazine masthead and occupies the ENTIRE screen "above the fold." The artile and site titles are proportional to one another&mdash;the same font size, but different font styles. The above-the-fold image typically contains a ton of negative space.</p>
	<p>Pulling author bio to side, using a mid grey rather than article-black sets up nice hierarchy. Ditto for editor's notes, pull-quoted in left margin.</p>

	<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>
	<h2>similar</h2>
	<p>The size and spacing create an etremely clear visual hierachy. The column width&mdash;and thick, empty white margins to left and right of article text&mdash;are effective, as is the vertical spacing between paragraphs. these all contribute to high readability.</p>
	<p>There is never/rarely competition between content. Size and spacing create a clear visual hierarchy. Both sites would probably function very well across screen sizes.</p>

	<h2>different</h2>
	<p>The size-variation in A List Apart feels too-much. Body text is slightly too small to read comfortably. </p>
	<p>Articles in Stet feel more stand-alone, like they're independent sites. A List apart feels more like it's part of a large body of work, and has more emphasis on navigating between articles.</p>
